Using mobile tech and AI to improve school meal programs in underserved Pakistani communities
# Bridging the Nutrition Gap: Mobile Tech & AI for School Meals in Pakistan

A research paper exploring how mobile technology and artificial intelligence can improve school meal programs in underserved communities across Pakistan. Written in collaboration with Allah Walay Trust.

Problem
Millions of Pakistani school children face chronic undernutrition and those who are hungry struggle to learn. Existing meal programs are inconsistent, underfunded, and hard to monitor.

Solution
This paper proposes the use of:
1- Mobile tech (meal tracking, SMS alerts, QR vouchers)
2- AI (demand forecasting, delivery optimization, trend analysis)

All grounded in Islamic values and AWT’s (Allah walay Trust) community presence.

Reflection

Working on this paper helped me connect the dots between technology and real world challenges in Pakistan. The digital divide, the power dynamics, the extremes of poverty in our country. I’ve also always been interested in AI and computer science so I paired the two topics and wrote this paper.

It also made me think about how small changes like better data, better tracking, or even SMS alerts can lead to big improvements in things like child nutrition and education. I hope this is just one of many projects I’ll take on that combine tech with empathy.
