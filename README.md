# Bridging the Nutrition Gap: Mobile Tech & AI for School Meals in Pakistan

A research paper exploring how mobile technology and artificial intelligence can improve school meal programs in underserved communities across Pakistan. Written in collaboration with Allah Walay Trust.

Problem
Millions of Pakistani school children face chronic undernutrition and those who are hungry struggle to learn. Existing meal programs are inconsistent, underfunded, and hard to monitor.

Solution
This paper proposes the use of:
1- Mobile tech (meal tracking, SMS alerts, QR vouchers)
2- AI (demand forecasting, delivery optimization, trend analysis)

All grounded in Islamic values and AWT’s (Allah walay Trust) community presence.
